If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference. The party initiating the claim must give notice to the other party in writing of its, his, or her intent to initiate an informal dispute resolution conference, which shall occur within 60 days after the other party receives such notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties.

Engaging in an informal dispute resolution conference is a requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. &nbsp; The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">(c) </span><span class="c10 c1">Arbitration Rules and Forum.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;FAA&rdquo;) in all respects. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply. Before a party may begin an arbitration proceeding, that party must send notice of an intent to initiate arbitration and certifying completion of the informal dispute resolution conference pursuant to paragraph 12(b). If this notice is being sent to Dely, it must be sent by email to the counsel who represented Dely in the informal dispute resolution process, or if there was no such counsel then by mail to General Counsel, 2 Liliencron Street, Windhoek, NA 10005.. The arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. under its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Arbitration demands filed with ADR Services, Inc. must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy, enumerated in Namibia Dollars (any request for injunctive relief or attorneys&rsquo; fees shall not count toward the calculation of the amount in controversy unless such injunctive relief seeks the payment of money); and (4) the signature of the party seeking arbitration.

Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by ADR Services, Inc.&rsquo;s rules. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay ADR Services, Inc.&rsquo;s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver of fees from ADR Services, Inc., Dely will pay them for you. If ADR Services, Inc. is not available to arbitrate, the parties will mutually select an alternative arbitral forum.

All disputes regarding the payment of arbitrator or arbitration-organization fees including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment, shall be determined exclusively by an arbitrator, and not by any court. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Dely. Except as expressly agreed to in Section 12(g) of this Agreement, the arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award, on an individual basis, monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different party. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.

There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c1">(f) </span><span class="c10 c1">Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</span><span class="c3 c1">&nbsp;EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY AGREED TO IN SECTION 12(G) OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND DOORDASH AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.

CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 12(G). If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or dispute, neither you nor Dely is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. InstTo increase efficiency of resolution, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands against Dely, presented by or with the assistance of the same law firm or organization, are submitted to an arbitration provider selected in accordance with the rules described above within a 30-day period, the arbitration provider shall (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 100 demands per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining demands); and (ii) provide for resolution of each batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and one arbitrator assigned per batch. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Dely and the arbitration provider to implement such a batch approach to resolution and fees.ead, all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Section 20.
